Entity classes are typically used in the context of Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) to map database tables to Java objects.

Entity Class: This class directly maps to a database table. Each instance of the class corresponds to a row in the table. It is often used with ORM frameworks like Hibernate or JPA.

DTO (Data Transfer Object) Class: This class is used to transfer data between layers (e.g., between the client and the server, or between different parts of the application). DTOs often contain a subset of the data that is needed for a particular operation and are not tied to the database schema.

VO (Value Object) Class: This class is used to represent a fixed set of data. It is immutable and used to transfer data but not to be modified.
